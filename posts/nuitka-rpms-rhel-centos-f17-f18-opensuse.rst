Thanks to contributor, Nuitka now has a proper RPM spec file. And using `openSUSE Build
Service
<https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=Nuitka&project=home%3Akayhayen>`__, we
can now enjoy RPMs for all major distributions.

Check out the revamped `download page </pages/download.html>`_.

.. note::

   At the time of this writing, the "stable" Nuitka 0.4.1 link points to a 0.4.2
   pre-release. That is only until 0.4.2 final will be released.

Thanks for making this possible, very much appreciated.
