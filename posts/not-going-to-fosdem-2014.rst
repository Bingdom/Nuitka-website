So I submitted a talk for FOSDEM "Python has a compiler now". And it didn't get
accepted. Quite a surprise to me, but likely mostly logical. These are the
`accepted talks <http://wirtel.be/tag/devroom.html>`__ and well, it surely
didn't fit in, right.

My intent was to introduce `Nuitka </pages/overview.html>`__ to the larger
community. Not going to happen now, but maybe next year.

Clearly triggered by the rejection, I am questioning Europython 2014 in Berlin
as a useful destination too. To me it seems, that code writing is the best way
to create the community at this time anyway.
