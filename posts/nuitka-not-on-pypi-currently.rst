.. admonition:: Update

   The issue has been fixed in PyPI and the upload has been performing. Going to retire
   this post soon.

This is just a short service announcement. The last Nuitka release mentioned that Nuitka is now available on PyPI as well.

That is no longer true, because it seems PyPI is rejecting Nuitka due to a 500 server
error (on the web page it is a unicode encoding error?!). The report has been made, but
not immediate reaction.

Unfortunately I have already deleted the old pre-releases as the idea was the keep only
stable releases on PyPI. My bad. Now it's only on the `regular Download page
<http:/pages/download.html>`_ available.

My apology for this hiccup, but it's beyond my control.

Yours,
Kay Hayen
