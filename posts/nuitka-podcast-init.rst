So, if you want to get to know Nuitka or me, there is a really good
interview from the popular podcast "__init__" online.

`Kay Hayen on Nuitka <http://pythonpodcast.com/kay-hayen-nuitka.html>`__

I think it's very good at explaining things, putting it into
perspective, history, future, and generally getting to know what
kind of person I am.

So, this is probably as good as it ever gets. So please share, like
and go ahead and spread it in this social media craziness that you
use all day.

Yours,
Kay
