Hello,

last thursday the family moved over to the new house. This meant a minor
downtime for the server that hosts Nuitka to secure it from damages. You have to
imagine this machine was running in my living room. It's a NAS with ARM and
native Debian support, QNAP TS-119, which served well and quiet in my home.

Now thanks to Deutsche Teuerkom monopoly on new telephone connections, I had to
make a contract with them, before my old contract can move to the new house as
well. They are well known for delays in the process. Seems that I will have no
phone and more important, no internet until 8.11. or worse, e.g. if I dare not
be reachable all day that day.

Currently the server can continue to run in the old home, but only max. 2nd
november, then I will have to hand over keys. It needed no supervision in the
past, so hopefully it will run on, and making a release has become tedious. I
think I will make one during the week, and tell you, grab it while you still
can. :-)
