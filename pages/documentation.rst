There is documentation available in HTML and PDF form.

Currently there is:

* `User Manual <../doc/user-manual.html>`_

  Recommended first read if you are interested in using Nuitka.

* `Developer Manual <../doc/developer-manual.html>`_

  Very detailed information intended for developers of Nuitka, explaining the
  design, and choices made.

.. note::

   The Debian and Redhat packages also contain man pages, otherwise ``nuitka
   --help`` will be useful.
