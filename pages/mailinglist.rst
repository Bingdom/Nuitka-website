We do have a mailing list, thanks to the kind people of freelist.org, who host
technical mailing lists with no advertising for free.

Visit http://www.freelists.org/list/nuitka-dev where you can subscribe or
unsubscribe to the list within seconds (confirmation needed).

And there is http://www.freelists.org/archive/nuitka-dev/ for the mailing list
archives.

For discussion of the blog, the Nuitka-website repository is best suited, and
awaits your pull requests to improve these pages.
