We do have a mailing list, thanks to the kind people of freelist.org, who host
technical mailing lists with no advertising for free.

Visit http://www.freelists.org/list/nuitka-dev where you can subscribe or
unsubscribe to the list within seconds (confirmation needed).

And there is http://www.freelists.org/archive/nuitka-dev/ for the mailing list
archives.

On the blog, for feedback and discussion of the Nuitka compiler, I am allowing
comments on the blog posts, but not the pages. Their contents changes and then
the comments may make no sense anymore.

Please report any bugs you find, either via

* A posting on the mailing list
* Or via to the roundup `bug tracker <http://bugs.nuitka.net>`_

It shouldn't be many and I will look into these timely enough either way, you
may find the email confirmations via bug tracker more convenient.
