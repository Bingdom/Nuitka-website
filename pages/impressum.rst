This is a personal blog, running on my personal machine. Its main mission is to serve as
a forum for my Python compiler work and announcements.

This website is purely personal and not commercial currently, yet the German laws require
me to disclose this information:

My postal address is Kay Hayen, Hegelstrasse 21, 76356 Weingarten, Germany.
